Data Exploration
Key insights from SQL exploration included:

  Trips Analysis: Identified peak hours and popular routes.
  Fare Evaluation: Analyzed fare structures and payment preferences.
  Performance Metrics: Examined success, fail, and conversion rates to understand service efficiency.
  Geographical Insights: Mapped high-demand areas.
  
Power BI Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard visualized:

  Trip Overview: Total trips, average fare, and time distribution.
  Revenue Analysis: Breakdown by fare method.
  Performance Metrics: Success, fail, and conversion rates.
  Heatmaps: Ride density and revenue by location.

Findings
  Optimize Peak Hours: Address demand with driver incentives or surge pricing.
  Adjust Fare Structures: Focus on popular payment methods.
